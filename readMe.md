This is a photo gallery project and for this one I use VanillaJavascript, based on click event listeners, you can browse for different photos,I've dinamically added buttons by measuring the width of the window and the dimensions of the photo and based on the index you can switch between photos.
I add and remove css classes and I am also using css grid.
